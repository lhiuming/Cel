- Issues

- Rendering
  - build a three-overlapping triangle test case (test color and z-buffer)
    - design an efficient rendering data format for soft renderer.
    - support vertex color
    - support depth buffer
  - make a true mesh (use half-edge or winged-triangle?)
  - add model loading, and support general mesh and material
    - skip texture currently
  - add sophisticated culling for better performance
