- Issues

- Rendering
  - move to Windows7 and Direct3D 11.
  - add model loading, and support general mesh and material
    - skip texture currently
  - make a true mesh (use half-edge or winged-triangle?)
    - that is good for providing shading information on CPU
    - also consider animating
  - add sophisticated culling for better performance
