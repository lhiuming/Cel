Project under construction

## todos

- Issues

- Rendering
  - Use hardware rendering directory
    - Build the hardware-based rendering framework with OpenGL
    - move to Windows10 and Direct3D 11.
  - make a true mesh (use half-edge or winged-triangle?)
    - that is good for providing shading infomation on CPU
  - add model loading, and support general mesh and material
    - skip texture currently
  - add sophisticated culling for better performance
