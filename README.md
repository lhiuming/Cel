# Cel

Project under construction.

Current State: this project is totally stalled now ;)

## todos

- Rendering
  - loading complete scene (lights, multiple meshes)
    - load glsl shade from file
    - add area light
    - test with cornel box
    - add key-press shading-switching
	- Add interaction in D3DViewer
  - add shadow maps and global light
  - add doxygen documentation
  - make a true mesh (use half-edge or winged-triangle?)
    - that is good for providing shading information on CPU
    - also consider animating
