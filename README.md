# Cel

Project under construction

## todos

- Rendering
  - add model loading, and support general mesh and material
    - skip texture currently
	- Add interaction in D3DViewer
  - loading complex scene
  - add shadow maps and global light 
  - make a true mesh (use half-edge or winged-triangle?)
    - that is good for providing shading information on CPU
    - also consider animating
